# Agents

This file defines how AI agents interact with the **Delivery Pilot Template** project.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Claude | `claude.md` | Full-stack dev, DevOps, 7-stage framework |
| Gemini | `gemini.md` | Multimodal analysis, image tasks |
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot.md` | GitHub-native integrations |
| Kilo Code | `kilocode.md` | Precision code generation |

## Agent Rules

- Always follow the 7-stage folder structure (`1_Real_Unknown` through `7_Testing_Known`)
- Never commit secrets — use Azure Key Vault for all sensitive values
- **After every command, commit and push** — do not batch changes; each step gets its own commit. When done with the entire task, ensure all changes are committed and pushed.
- Place files in the correct numbered folder based on their stage:
  - **1_Real_Unknown**: Update if there is a new objective or Key Result (OKR) change.
  - **2_Environment**: Update environment-related files here if there is a change in the environment.
  - **3_Simulation**: If the abstract UI is updated, create/generate an image and place/mention it here.
  - **4_Formula**: If there is a new way of working, recipe, or build logic, document it here. Also, document a summary of the Large Language Model's thinking phase/reasoning process in this folder after executions.
  - **5_Symbols**: All new source code must be placed here, except for files that must stay in the root folder (e.g., `index.html`, `markdown_renderer.html`).
  - **6_Semblance**: Document all encountered errors, workarounds, and gap analyses here.
  - **7_Testing_Known**: Place testing validation, checklists, and proof of working here.
- Use emojis for scannability in documentation
- **Record every prompt** — all prompts given to agents must be logged in `prompts.md` with date, agent name, purpose, and what was done.
- **README.md must include the public GitHub Pages URL** — e.g., `https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/<repo-name>/` (see [proxmox example](https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/proxmox/))
- **Keep `index.html` at the repo root** — GitHub Pages requires it at the root for the site to work
- **Two menus required** — Project Menu (always visible, project-specific) + Debug Menu (bottom-right button, shows 7 stages + agent files). See `2_Environment/navigation.md`
- **Active Reflection Routine** — Write a short "retrospective journal" in `6_Semblance/lessons_learned.md` after every milestone (both humans and AI agents must follow this rule).


## Secrets Management

All agents use **Azure Key Vault** for secrets:

- **Why:** Enterprise-grade security (FIPS 140-2 HSMs, RBAC, audit logs) at low cost (~$0.03/10K operations)
- **How:** Load secrets at runtime via Azure SDK or GitHub Actions `Azure/get-keyvault-secrets`
- **Rule:** Never store secrets in code, config files, or git history

## Agent Coordination

When multiple agents work on the same project:

1. Read the relevant `*.md` persona file before making changes
2. Follow the testing checklist in `7_Testing_Known/README.md`
3. Document any workarounds in `6_Semblance/`
4. Keep `4_Formula/` updated with step-by-step guides for new patterns
